DevFest2013-Workshop
====================

Material for workshop "From Java to Scala" on DevFest2013

We will use Typesafe Activator to avoid Scala&IDE and IntelliJ IDEA instalations.

When you download this package (see the "download ZIP" button or https://github.com/scala-vienna/devfest2013/archive/master.zip), you'll
get a package with a number of directories; the only one you need to follow the
is the directory titled **src.** You can ignore the rest of the
files and directories, which are used by Typesafe Activator.

Within the "src" directory you will find all the files that are going to
be used in the workshop.

To use Typesafe Activator code editor, simply run the **./activator ui**
shell script (Macintosh & Linux) or the **activator.bat ui** batch file (Windows),
which you will find in the main directory of the unzipped download.

If you discover problems or errors, please report them to:
